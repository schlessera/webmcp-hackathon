# Enriching a place beyond the map: sources, what they give, what we use

Researched and measured 2026-09-02. Companion to `docs/DATA-QUALITY.md`
(the base layer) — this document is about everything a room can learn about
a place **beyond** its OpenStreetMap record: menus, links, descriptions,
ratings, awards, more attributes.

The constraints are the same as for the base layer: no third-party call from
a participant's browser; nothing committed that is not redistributable;
nothing cached in violation of a source's terms; no fabricated facts; every
fact labelled with where it came from.

## Summary

Three sources ship, all server-side, all evidence-labelled:

| # | source | licence | gives | how |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S1 | OpenStreetMap's own long tail | ODbL | menu URL, opening-hours page, Instagram, description, vegan / gluten-free / halal, takeaway, delivery, Wikidata id | more tags kept in the snapshot (`KEPT_TAGS`); no request at all |
| S2 | the place's own website | the venue's | schema.org facts (cuisine, price range, hours, accessibility, self-published rating, menu, reservations), menu link discovery, one-line description | one fetch per place, robots.txt honoured, cached 7 days, parsed facts only |
| S3 | Wikidata | CC0 | description, Wikipedia article, official site, awards (Michelin star, Bib Gourmand) | one entity fetch for places carrying a `wikidata` tag, cached 7 days |

Ratings from review platforms are **not** available under our constraints
(details below). What a room sees as a rating is what the place publishes
about itself, labelled "as published by the place", or an award on record.

## What was measured

### S1 — what OpenStreetMap already carried and we were dropping

Focus discs (1.4 km around each default centre), named places with the
product's amenity tags:

| tag | Berlin Mitte (890) | SF SoMa (957) |
|---|---|---|
| `website` / `contact:website` | 501 | 473 |
| `website:menu` | 48 | 59 |
| `opening_hours:url` | — | 99 |
| `contact:instagram` | 48 | 128 |
| `description` | 23 | 34 |
| `diet:vegan` | 190 | 33 |
| `diet:gluten_free` | 15 | — |
| `diet:halal` | 17 | 17 |
| `takeaway` | 133 | 206 |
| `delivery` | 52 | 15 |
| `toilets:wheelchair` | 190 | 15 |
| `wikidata` | 13 | 13 |
| `brand:wikidata` | 80 | 97 |
| `contact:yelp` | — | 30 |

Kept now. The five booleans became attributes (`vegan-options`,
`gluten-free-options`, `halal-options`, `takeaway`, `delivery`), which also
makes them needs a room can state and pills the composer can offer.

### S2 — what venues publish on their own sites

Crawled the 80 nearest pool venues with a website tag per city
(`data/osm/crawl.mjs`, one request each, identifying User-Agent):

| | Berlin | SF |
|---|---|---|
| reachable (HTTP 200) | 65 / 80 | 60 / 80 |
| any JSON-LD | 40 | 41 |
| a business-typed node | 34 | 32 |
| a food-typed node (Restaurant, Cafe, Bar…) | 13 | 13 |
| `servesCuisine` | 4 | 7 |
| `priceRange` | 6 | 7 |
| `openingHours` | 14 | 15 |
| `aggregateRating` | 4 | 3 |
| `amenityFeature` | 1 | 4 |
| `hasMenu` / `menu` | 5 | 3 |
| **a menu link anywhere on the page** | **46** | **45** |

Read: the structured facts are thin (4–18 % of sites), but a **menu link
is found on 56 %** of sites, and the facts that do exist are the venue's
own word, published for machines. So the menu link is the reliable win,
the facts a bonus, and both carry a `web:<host>` source.

### S3 — Wikidata

13 places per focus disc carry a `wikidata` tag; those are the notable ones
(historic cafés, starred restaurants). Wikidata models cuisine as P2012,
awards as P166 (Michelin star Q20824563, Bib Gourmand Q16143906), the
official site as P856, and links the Wikipedia article. CC0: storable,
redistributable, no attribution obligation (we attribute anyway).

## Sources evaluated and not used

| source | licence / terms | verdict |
|---|---|---|
| **Foursquare OS Places** (100M+ POIs, monthly, Parquet on S3 / Hugging Face, gated) | Apache-2.0 | 22 attributes: name, address, tel, website, email, socials, categories, dates. **No hours, ratings, price, photos, tips or menus** — those are the paid API. Would fill website / phone gaps (≈45 % of our focus places have no website tag). Not wired: an offline join against a multi-GB dataset for a gap the venue sites and OSM cover partly already. Documented as the next offline step. |
| **Overture Places** (53M+, monthly, Parquet on S3) | CDLA-Permissive-2.0 / Apache-2.0 | names, categories, websites, socials, phones, brand, confidence. Same shape as Foursquare OS; same verdict. |
| **Foursquare Places API** | commercial | 500 free Pro calls/month, then $15/1k; ratings, tips, hours and photos bill from the first call; content not storable. Key the judges cannot see working. |
| **Yelp Fusion** | commercial | no free tier in 2026; content may not be cached beyond 24 h. |
| **Google Places** | commercial | Places content may only be shown on a Google map; no caching; no lactose-free field. Rejected 2026-09-01 (`DATA-QUALITY.md`). |
| **HERE Places** | freemium | hours, contacts, categories; caching ≤30 days only to serve the end user; key-dependent. Not wired. |
| **TomTom Search** | freemium (2,500/day) | POI search; storage terms unclear; key-dependent. Not wired. |
| **Tripadvisor Content API** | legacy sunset 2026-08-31 | gone. |
| **Open Food Facts** | ODbL | packaged products, not venues; allergen data does not attach to a restaurant. Not applicable. |
| **Michelin Guide site** | proprietary | no API; the awards reach us through Wikidata instead. |
| **HappyCow / Find Me Gluten Free** | proprietary | no API; terms forbid extraction. |

## How it lands in a room

- `enrichments` (migration 010), keyed by OSM ref, shared by every room that
  holds the place, TTL 7 days. `candidates.osm_ref` and `candidates.extras`
  (links, description, lookup ids from the record) were added alongside.
- **When**: a new room's pool is warmed in the background (4 at a time);
  `inspect_candidates` (the place panel, or an agent) waits up to 3.5 s for
  a fresh lookup and otherwise opens with what is cached, the lookup
  finishing behind it. The classifier reads the cache only; it never waits
  on the network.
- **Precedence**: a verified record fact (`osm:*`, `curated:*`) is never
  overwritten. A looked-up fact fills `unknown` / `unverified` slots:
  cuisine, price band, wheelchair (verified, `web:<host>`), hours
  (unverified only). Attestations (`agent:*`) merge after and can dispute a
  looked-up fact like any other (`SPATIAL-PROTOCOL.md` §8.1).
- **What the panel shows**: links with server-authored labels (website,
  menu, opening hours, reservations, Wikipedia, Instagram), a one-line
  description with its source, awards, and a rating only when the place
  published one, labelled as such. Nothing in the client names a domain:
  link kinds, labels and sources are data.
- **Off switch**: `ENRICH_NETWORK=0` keeps a server off the network (test
  servers set it). `room_demo` is never warmed; opening a place there looks
  it up like anywhere else.

## Not done

- Foursquare OS Places / Overture as an offline join for website and phone
  gaps (Berlin ≈ 45 %, SF ≈ 50 % of focus places have no website tag).
- Resolving Wikidata cuisine item labels (P2012) — ids are stored, labels
  are not looked up.
- Parsing `openingHoursSpecification` objects into the hours table (only the
  `openingHours` string form is read, and only to `unverified`).
- Reading a menu's contents. The link is offered; the text stays the venue's.
